# Gambling-on-Unemployment-DiD

## About
Initially was the final project/paper for ECON 427 (Econometrics II), but will be continued until I feel satisfied. The paper implements an event study design (Sun and Abraham 2021) in order to investigate the effects of the staggered legalization of sports betting on unemployment. The paper is written in LaTeX, which will probably be added here later.

## Notes
The paper is not yet finished, as I will have to implement some cross-checks, but it will be finished.
